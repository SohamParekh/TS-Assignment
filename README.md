#Assignment of Typescript

1. Create a typeScript application and disable the use of implicit any type (objects should not be assigned the any type, when no type is specified)

2. Create an Interface Person that has two properties, Name, and Age.

3. Create a class Student that implements the interface Person, and has properties Class and favourite subject

4. Create a class School that contains a List of Students. And a School Name.

5. Create an HTML form to add a new Student which requires all the needed fields to be filled. The fields should allow only the values that make sense. For example, age should allow only numbers. But it should not allow letters like 'e'. A student is not allowed to be added until all the necessary fields are put and appropriate messages are to be displayed if the fields are not filled.

6. Add a search box where you can enter a school name and all the students of that school name will be displayed. The search box should not allow me to enter values that have no connection to a school name, for instance, symbols or numbers. and appropriate messages should be displayed in case other values are entered.

7. The compiled output should be created in a folder called 'myCompiledOutput'.

8. The code pushed to Git should not have anything other than source and configuration files (output files should not be there, neither should the support package files)
